manage access to&nbsp;selected beaches during peak periods to avoid overcrowding.
Entry to the beaches will be allowed only through designated access points
manned by NParks staff and volunteers. There will also be roving NParks
staff and volunteers to educate the public on intertidal biodiversity,
etiquette and remind them not to remove marine life indiscriminately.&nbsp;</p>
