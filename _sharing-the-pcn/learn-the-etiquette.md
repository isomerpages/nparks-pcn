##   Promoting Graciousness on our PCN!

Since 2021, we have been working with various partners to promote the spirit of graciousness and kindness on our Park Connector Network.

To make it a pleasant and safe experience for all on the PCN, we encourage all users to keep a 'look out' for others, 'give way' to slower users and at cross junctions, 'slow down' when approaching attention zones and 'keep left' when using the Park Connectors.

As part of our PCN Etiquette Campaign, we collaborated with Singapore Kindness Movement (SKM) to launch our inaugural PCN Kindness Campaign in 2022.

We have also installed over 300 PCN etiquette banners island-wide and published an article on the PCN with The Smart Local in 2022. <br>[Click here to read the article!](https://thesmartlocal.com/read/park-connectors-singapore/)

We hope all users will stay gracious and courteous, and keep a look out for our PCN etiquette messages when you are on our Park Connector Network!
