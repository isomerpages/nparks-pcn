We're excited to partner with Singapore Kindness Movement (SKM) once again for the Park Connector Network (PCN) Kindness Campaign 2023 – join us in spreading kindness and positivity on our park connectors! 😊  

This year’s campaign will feature our first ever PCN thematic trail along Punggol Waterway! As part of the thematic trail, you can look forward to cheerful and engaging PCN etiquette and SKM installations that will inspire acts of kindness.

Help us spread the positivity while you’re there! Snap and upload pics with at least **ONE** of the SKM Kindness Cubbies installations in a Facebook/Instagram post, and include the hashtag #pcnkindness. Remember to make your post public! 10 lucky winners stand to win grocery vouchers worth $50 each! ✌🏻

You may also use our NParks Explore A Route (NEAR) mobile app to locate the SKM Kindness Cubbies installations along Punggol Waterway.
